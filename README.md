# LibFT

This is a library of C functions that I created when I attended a software engineering program (42 Coding School). The purpose of this bootcamp was to learn programming, specifically C, at a deeper level. This was acheived by writing original code for all projects, which meant I was not allowed to not rely on C's libraries and hence had to create my own library of functions.

This gave me experience in proper code formatting and software development.
